# SOCTools
Selected SOC tools for new aspirants.

Suricata: Suricata is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that monitors network traffic for malicious activities and provides real-time alerts. It supports high-speed packet processing, signature-based detection, and protocol analysis.

OSSEC: OSSEC is a host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) that monitors logs, file integrity, rootkit detection, and policy violations on individual systems. It provides centralized logging and real-time alerts for detecting and responding to security incidents.

Snort: Snort is a widely-used Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that analyzes network traffic to detect and alert on suspicious activities. It can perform signature-based detection, protocol analysis, and anomaly detection to identify potential threats.

Bro: Bro, now known as Zeek, is a Network Security Monitor that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. It provides deep visibility into network protocols and generates detailed logs that can be used for network monitoring, analysis, and incident response.

Zeek: Zeek is an open-source network analysis framework, formerly known as Bro. It captures and interprets network traffic, generating high-level protocol logs that provide insights into network behavior, security incidents, and potential threats.

Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine. In the context of SOC, it is used for storing and indexing large volumes of security-related data, such as logs, alerts, and events. Elasticsearch enables efficient searching, analysis, and visualization of security data.

Logstash: Logstash is a data processing pipeline that collects, transforms, and filters data from various sources, including logs and events. It facilitates the ingestion and normalization of security data into Elasticsearch for further analysis and visualization.

Kibana: Kibana is a web-based data visualization and exploration tool that works in conjunction with Elasticsearch. It allows SOC analysts to create interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs to visualize and analyze security data in real-time.

Wazuh: Wazuh is an open-source security platform that combines host-based intrusion detection, log management, file integrity monitoring, and security analytics. It provides centralized security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response capabilities.

These tools collectively help establish a comprehensive security monitoring and incident response infrastructure within a SOC, enabling the detection, analysis, and mitigation of security threats and incidents.
